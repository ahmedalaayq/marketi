## 🎨 UI Showcase (Selected & Organized)

I selected a few representative screenshots and organized them into a clean 2×2 grid for better visual reading.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="assets/screenshots/login.png" alt="Product Details" width="320"/>
      <div><strong>Login</strong></div>
    </td>
      <td align="center">
      <img src="assets/screenshots/register.png" alt="Product Details" width="320"/>
      <div><strong>Register</strong></div>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="assets/screenshots/home.png" alt="Home" width="320"/>
      <div><strong>Home Screen</strong></div>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="assets/screenshots/details.png" alt="Categories" width="320"/>
      <div><strong>Product Details</strong></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
